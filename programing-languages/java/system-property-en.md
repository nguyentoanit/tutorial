# System Property in Java
## What is Properties in Java
Properties are configuration values managed as key/value pairs. In each pair, the key and value are both String values.

To manage properties create instances of [java.util.Properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html)
- loading key/value pairs into a Properties object from a stream
- retrieving a value from its key,
- listing the keys and their values,
- enumerating over the keys, and
- saving the properties to a stream.
